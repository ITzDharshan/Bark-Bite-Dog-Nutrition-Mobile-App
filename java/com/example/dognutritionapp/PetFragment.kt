Dogs require a mix of proteins, fats, vitamins, minerals, and fiber to maintain optimal health. Feeding a well-rounded diet tailored to their age, breed, and activity level can enhance longevity and reduce the risk of chronic conditions. When planning your dogâ€™s meals, avoid human foods that can disrupt their nutritional balance and consult your vet for advice on portion sizes."

Proteins help build and repair muscles, while fats provide energy and aid in nutrient absorption. Carbohydrates offer fiber for digestion, while vitamins and minerals support immunity and metabolic functions. Ensuring your dog's diet includes these nutrients can help prevent deficiencies and promote overall well-being."

Use quality proteins like chicken or beef, paired with grains (like rice) and vegetables for balanced nutrition. Avoid adding salt, sugar, and foods that can harm dogs, such as onions or garlic. Consult your veterinarian before switching to homemade food, as they can provide insights into portion control and supplement needs. Homemade meals should also be varied to ensure all nutrient requirements are met."

These foods can cause issues ranging from mild stomach upset to severe poisoning. Knowing which foods are toxic and understanding the symptoms of poisoning (like vomiting and lethargy) can help you act quickly in an emergency. When in doubt, only give your dog food specifically made for pets."
